## Unsea Cloud Software website

Congrats! You've found the GitHub repository for the Unsea Cloud Software website. There's really not much to it. It is just a basic Next.js site without any back-end.

Feel free to clone this repository and/or use parts of the website in your own projects. All images (excluding icons) are designed by myself, Wouter Deen.
